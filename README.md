# Microservices
TheConnMan's venture into microservices

This repo represents a collection of microservices for a very basic distributed message processing system. The app will be boring, but the system will be cool (I hope)

## Toolstack
- AngularJS
- Node.js
- RabbitMQ
- Grails
- MySQL
- Docker

## Usage
- Set up Docker for your machine
- Run `poor-mans-docker-compose.sh -a`
- Wait until all containers are up and the **rest-server** logs read:
	> Grails application running at http://localhost:8080 in environment: production
- Go to the Docker VM IP address
